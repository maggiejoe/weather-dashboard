# Weather Dashboard


## Description
The weather dashboard is an application created to give the user current and future weather data based off of their searched city.

## Challenges
My biggest challenge was towards the end of the project when I was creating the 'futureForecast()`. I had an issue with findng the right place to call the function but once that was figured out, finishing off that function to get the data on the page dynamically was no problem!
